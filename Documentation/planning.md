# Problem Statement
A major issue is resolved by the **Bristol Education Data Portal**: **finding accurate, up-to-date information about schools in Bristol and surrounding areas is frustratingly scattered.** Parents, students, and researchers currently juggle council websites, Ofsted reports, and word-of-mouth recommendations.

All of this is combined on our website into **one user-friendly platform** where users can: **Search primary/secondary schools and colleges** by location (e.g., Bristol, Cardiff, Gloucester, etc.). Addresses, the official website of the school or college, and embedded maps are all available for instant access. **Compare institutions** without requiring the user to open more than ten tabs in their browser.
The data came from Bristol's Open Data initiative and the official school website.

We place a higher priority on **speed, clarity, and actionable insights.** displaying a school's website link directly next to its map location, in contrast to council directories, which lack usability.

# Benefits & Options
The purpose of this platform is to help teachers, parents, and students find out more about Bristol's schools and the surrounding areas. Rather than squandering hours looking through PDF reports and files, council websites, or word-of-mouth recommendations, users can find everything they need in one convenient location.

This site has removed families' need to make informed guesses looking for a school. Direct links to the official sites of all elementary, secondary, and postsecondary educational institutions; interactive maps showing distances; location tags indicating whether a school is in Bristol, Gloucester, or another location. No more juggling out-of-date PDFs or tab-switching; just straightforward knowledge helping to guide decisions. The final goal is to make this more than a directory. Imagine being able to rapidly compare Ofsted ratings, keep a shortlist of preferred schools, and view bus routes overlaid on maps. These qualities would make a good tool into a necessary resource for anyone using the local education system.

# Costs & Risks
This platform was made and designed to be cost-effective in Bristol's Free Open Data APIs, minimizing back-end expenses by simply focusing on the front-end of the website, with no trouble of log-in or sign-up. This way, hosting services with be our only recurring costs. Maintance will primarly involve the monitoring of API changes, and optimizing mobile responsiveness-tasks. This will require more than minimal developing hours. The biggest risk we face is the reliance on third-party data. Unless Bristol's APIs change, we have nothing to worry. But, if they change unexpectedly, our maps will be embeddedless, and the school list with address and extra information will break. Weâ€™ll mitigate this with cached fallback data and regular compatibility checks.

Although they can be scaled gradually, future expansions (such as user accounts or multi-city coverage) would raise costs. There may be small fees associated with collaborating with local councils to provide more datasets. The site's sustainability and adaptability are ensured by prioritising core functionality first, offering long-term value without necessitating a large upfront investment. Through user testing, pain points will be further identified before they develop into costly issues.
