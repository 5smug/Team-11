# Project Proposal
## Business Case
### Problem Statement
Local authorities handle numarous public services. These services are known as: housing, transortation, social programs and many more. However, decision marking is often challenged by fragmented data, inefficient reporting systems and a lack of real insights on said needs.
This project aims to leverage open data from **Bristol's Local Autorithies** to improve data accessibility, improve service planning and drive data policy decisions.
By analyzing trend in local government operations, we can identify and optimize resource allocation, fix inefficiencies or support them in any needs possible, and support evidence based remarks.

### Business benefits
This business would help the people of Bristol in multiple ways. Some of those ways being: 
**Data-Driven Decision-making** - This would benefit the people of Bristol because it enables local authorities to make informed policy and budget decision.
**Cost Savings & Efficiency** - This would reduce the unnecessary spending through better financial planning, and would make reports and analytics automatic, while it cuts administing burders.
There are more ways this business would help, some of those can be named as **more sustainable city initiatives, enhanced collaboration, and improved public service.** These options having more than one attribute which could help out Bristol. Bringing easier choice to all its users.

### Options Considered
There are more platforms which can give you similar information with ours. Websites like **https://data.gov.uk/**. However, although **data.gov** can give you usefull information about similar datasets, this website lacks real-time analytics and tailored insight for local authorities. Meaning that some of its data can be outdated or not usefull for different searches.
For shorter reference, this project aims to bridge the gap by offering a cost-effective, more scalabale, and more user friendly tool tailored to Bristol Local Authorities. Focusing more on insights, real-time analytics, and easy accesibility for decision making without requiring deep/high or even medium technical knowledge.

### Expected Risks
A major risk we face is the data **quality & availability** for our website and users. Main risk being that the Bristol local authorities dataset may contain incomplete, outdated, or inconsistent data. This meaning that unless we find something to mitigate the validation of data thorughout our processes, some information can be found unwanted or not usefull enough to many users.
Another major risk we face is the **adoption & usability** for our users. Main risk being that the council staff may be unfamiliar or not as attracted to the new way of the tools used for making our **data-driven & decision-making**.

## Project Scope
The scope of this website is to focus on leveraging open data from **Bristol's Local Authorities** to improve the decision-making, service efficiency and public transparency. We plan to integrate this by using the full extend of the **local authorities dataset**, using it as the main data source, having every other way of collecting data second to the dataset. Other public information or dataset knowledge will be mostly used for housing, transport and social services related budget. Besides these issues, we also wish to have a smooth **compliance & security** access for local authority staff and analysts.
