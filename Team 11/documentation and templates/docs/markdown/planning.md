# Problem Statement
The **open source bristol data website**, is a brand-new website designed and created with the purpose of making searching for information, values, and needs faster with better security for both searching and protecting your privacy. In this website, you can find bike pumps and tool stations throughout the entire Bristol. You will have 3 sections, one that will show you the name of the area, who is maintained by, the type, and insert a photo so that it can find the location faster. The second section, will be dedicated to "Bike Tool Station". This section is similar to the first one but with a twist. You can only see tool stations. The process is the same, shows a name, who is maintained by, and insert a photo. Same with the third options, just changes from "Tool station" to "On street bike pump".

# Benefits
This benefits bicyclist to find a more direct and faster path to either of the needs.
